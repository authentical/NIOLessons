StreamHandler only does one thing... manage the in/out streams but

I think it's a mistake calling the next encapsulating
decorator PrintingHandler because it's duty is to Print around the
StreamHandler and socket connection info.
Why not ConnectionInformationHandler? This breaks a rule though since
PrintingHandler can call any handleable Handler with <S>
